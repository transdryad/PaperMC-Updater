# PaperMC Updater

This simple script downloads the latest build for a specified PaperMC version and checks its hash. If the hash matches 
what the PaperMC API expects it to be, the new server jar is marked as executable.

It is meant to be run in the same folder as the paper jarfile,
so that it can place plugin downloads in the correct location.
